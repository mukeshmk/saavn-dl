- Vite
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion

---

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

---

## ffmpeg.wasm Requirements

`ffmpeg.wasm` requires `SharedArrayBuffer`, which means these headers must be enabled:

```txt
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Vite dev server already sets these automatically.

For production deployments (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Nginx, etc.), configure them manually.

---

## Cloudflare Pages (`public/_headers`)

```txt
/*
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

---

## Vercel (`vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
          "value": "same-origin"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy",
          "value": "require-corp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Decryption

`src/utils/decrypt.ts`

Uses:
- DES
- ECB mode
- PKCS7 padding

via CryptoJS using key:

```txt
38346591
```

The decrypted media URL is dynamically modified depending on selected quality.
